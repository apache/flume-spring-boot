1. What is Apache Flume Spring Boot
Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of event
data. Flume Spring Boot allows Flume to be packaged and configured as a
regular Spring boot application.

2. Major Changes in This Release
For a detailed list of changes, please see the CHANGELOG file included
in this distribution.

Apache Flume Spring Boot 2.0.0 modifies how application configuration is
wired into Spring. Prior releases used a mechanism that prevented Spring Cloud
from iniitializing properly. Applications should now add a declaration for
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration to META-INF/spring.properties
that references a configuration class that contains a @ComponentScan annotation.

4. How to Get Involved
